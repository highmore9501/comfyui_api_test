This project's function is to utilize the API file exported by comfyUI, allowing users to customize the exposable parameters, and create a more concise and user-friendly interface for comfyUI - or a "facade", if you prefer. This allows ordinary users to effortlessly utilize comfyUI without being confused by the intricate interface and numerous parameters.

## Other Notes

This project does not have a backend, so after editing and setting up the workflow, clicking save will only generate a JSON file. To see the changes, copy the contents of the JSON file and paste them into `public/workflow/sdxl_img2img_setting.json`, then refresh `http://localhost:3000`.
