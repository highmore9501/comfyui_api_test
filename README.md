## Other Notes

This project does not have a backend, so after editing and setting up the workflow, clicking save will only generate a JSON file. To see the changes, copy the contents of the JSON file and paste them into `public/workflow/sdxl_img2img_setting.json`, then refresh `http://localhost:3000`.
